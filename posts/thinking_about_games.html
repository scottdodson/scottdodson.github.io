            Writing a technical specification for a nonlinear experience is a challenge. Writing itself is linear. It
            starts somewhere and progresses to a conclusion. Nonlinear experiences will start with some set of
            conditions and no experience will occur outside the technical confines of the product.

            I think of this outer boundary as the shell of a three-dimensional object.

            Three dimensions represent volume. The simplest regular solid is a tetrahedron. If the vertices of
            a tetrahedron are thought of as a subject heading, the linear transition from one heading to another
            describes a relationship. Four possible headings may define a game. Following are ones I have used.
        <div>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>the World - objects and physical rules of a game environment</li>
                <li>the Toy - mechanisms the player uses to interact with the game world.</li>
                <li>the Game - rules that govern success, failure, reward, and consequence.</li>
                <li>the Story - representative content contextualizing the World, Toy, and Game.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            By thinking of a tetrahedron defined by these four points, one can conceive the whole of video game
            existing within a boundary. Thinking about relationships is simplified. Is the Toy fun? If we change the
            Toy, how that that impact the other elements? The Toy/World relationship is a sandbox that runs without rules.
