            This post is a live journal of my work to create a receipt reader.

            I have always been something of a data
            nerd. Tracking exchanges over time is a fantastic way to 'reality check' understanding and presumptions. I
            have been wanting to do sort of analysis for grocery purchases. Purchase data exists, I am certain, at the
            retail provider, but I have not (yet) seen an easy way to get detailed purchase history from most retailers.
            Amazon comes closest! Their purchase history functionality is great.

            Last week I started doing experiments with a Jupyter Notebook and some rubber ducking with ChatGPT and Gemini.
            Both OpenAI and Google LLM products convert a picture of a receipt into fields and json beautifully. I am
            working with Gemini today to break down how to use Tesseract to replicate the LLM result.

            Why bother? I am curious, and diving into the weeds of how things work is one of my things.

            Redirecting to leveraging some existing service for receipt translation.
