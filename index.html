                Welcome to my GitHub presence. I am a career technologist who completed a Bachelor of Science in
                Computer Science at the University of Washington in 2023. My interests are broad and varied, I
                love to engage in conversation about anything really. Here on my GitHub I focus on those technical
                subjects that have my attention, security, systems management, games, and how to make insightful
                management of technology accessible to a general audience.
